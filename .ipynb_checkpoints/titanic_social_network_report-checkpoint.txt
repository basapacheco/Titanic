Comprehensive Analysis and Prediction of Titanic Passengers' Survival Using Machine Learning

1. Descriptive Statistics and Initial Analysis:
   - The data was grouped by survival status and mean values for numeric columns were calculated.
   - Analysis showed differences in average age, fare, and class between survivors and non-survivors.

2. Gender Analysis:
   - Male passengers: 577
   - Female passengers: 314
   - Survival rate for females: 0.74
   - Survival rate for males: 0.19

3. Class and Age Analysis:
   - Survival rates varied significantly by class and age.
   - Higher survival rates were observed in higher classes and among younger passengers.

4. SibSp, Pclass, Age, and Embarked Analysis:
   - Analysis of survival rates based on number of siblings/spouses, class, age, and embarkation point.
   - Notable differences in survival rates based on these factors.

5. Model Training and Evaluation:
   - Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.76
   - SVM Accuracy: 0.66
   - K-Nearest Neighbors Accuracy: 0.66
   - Naive Bayes Accuracy: 0.77
   - Decision Tree Accuracy: 0.74

Conclusion:
   - The Naive Bayes model was chosen as the best model based on its accuracy score of 0.77.
   - This model was used to predict the survival of passengers in the test dataset.
